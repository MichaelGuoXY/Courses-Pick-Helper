# Courses-Pick-Helper
Scans constantly your shopping cart on your student centre account and helps you enroll very fast !!!
Version 1.0 --- Basically help you with enrolling courses in your shopping cart
of your student centre account when it's "OPEN". Note that this will succeed iff
 there is no conflict of this course with other courses you've enrolled in.

What you should do before run "python crawler.py" is fill out the "login.txt" with correct information of yours.

After you've done with that, the "login.txt" will look like this:
your_netid
your_netid_pwd
your_phone_number
your_gmail_addr
